1. Jalen prototype:
-------------------

The Jalen prototype has been build as one agent module in the Jalen project:
- Agent: a bytecode instrumentation agent for profiling applications. It calculates and provides power values in real-time.

The goal of the prototype is to provide a minimal functional code to prove the viability of our approach.

Version: 0.0.3

Last update : 13/03/2012 (13 March 2012)


2. Requirements:
----------------

This prototype requires the following libraries and tools:
- Maven2 to compile and run the prototype
- ASM 3 library


3. Usage:
---------

To build and compile all modules:
-> mvn clean package

In order to run a program with the agent, use -javaagent property.
For example, to run TowersOfHanoi.jar with the Jalen agent, use this command:

-> java -javaagent:target/jalen-0.0.3.jar -jar resources/TowersOfHanoi.jar 100

The 100 at the end is the number of towers in the towers of hanoi program (100 should take a lot of time to solve).

If you have erros with instrumentations, try to manually copy asm-3.3.1.jar from resources/ folder to target/ foler.

The agent will produce power values each monitoring cycle (by default 1 second) and append them to a dumpData.csv file.
The monitoring cycle duration, the path to the dump data file, and the nature of the output can be configured by modifying the config.properties file.
